                <h3>Zeus</h3>
                <p>Zeus is now looking for his forever home! Zeus arrived to us due to a change in his owners living
                    situation and they could no longer keep him. He is an active young dog who walks well on a lead, is
                    muzzle and crate trained and absolutedly obsessed with belly rubs. He is neutered, chipped and fully
                    vacinated.
                <ul>
                    <strong>His ideal home would be as follows;</strong>
                    <li>With or without another dog</li>
                    <li>No cats</li>
                    <li>Dog savy kids</li>
                    <li>A small garden for zoomies</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="right-dog">
                <h3>Monty</h3>
                <p>Yes we are aware this little fella isn't a staffy! However, we made an exception in this case.
                    Originally imported from the United States as a Covid puppy, his owners no longer "had the time" to
                    look after him and attempted to put him to sleep. Thankfully, the vets contacted us instead and we
                    took him in. He is neutered, chipped and fully vacinated. He is crate trained but can get nervous
                    when walking on a lead as he hasn't seen much of the outside world but is improving each day.
                <ul>
                    <strong>His ideal home will be as follows;</strong>
                    <li>As an only dog</li>
                    <li>Dog savvy kids</li>
                    <li>Someone who is familiar with the French Bulldog breed and their requirements</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="center-dog">
                <h3>Sandy</h3>
                <p>When Sandy first came to us, she was a malnourished, frightened little girl. She was initially found
                    on the side of the road with a deep gash along her back left leg and thanks to some wonderful
                    people, was quickly brought to a vet where she was treated, neutered, vaccinated and microchipped.
                    Since then, Sandy has improved remarkably and we are so happy with her. She walks well on the lead
                    and loves to play with a tennis ball. Although her crate training remains a work in progress. This
                    little girl is ready to
                    find her forever home.</p>
                <ul>
                    <strong>Her ideal home will be as follows;</strong>
                    <li>As an only dog</li>
                    <li>She loves the car</li>
                    <li>She loves cats</li>
                    <li>A small garden to play in and sunbathe</li>
