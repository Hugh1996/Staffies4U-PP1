                    <h2>Popularity</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The Staffordshire Terrier has gained popularity in Ireland over the years. They are often chosen
                        as companion and family
                        dogs. The popularity of the breed has
                        also brought attention to responsible ownership and breed-specific legislation. Educating owners
                        on responsible dog
                        ownership, promoting positive training methods, and advocating for fair legislation are crucial
                        aspects of ensuring the
                        well-being and positive perception of the breed. It's important for potential owners to research
                        and understand the breed's specific needs and requirements.

                    <h2>Temperament</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Staffies are friendly and affectionate dogs. They are often referred to as "nanny dogs" because
                        of their
                        love for children and
                        protective instincts. They are generally good-natured, courageous, and eager to please. Early
                        socialization and training
                        are important for their well-being. They are intelligent and can be quick learners. They respond
                        well to positive
                        reinforcement training
                        methods. Early socialization and obedience training are crucial to help them become
                        well-mannered adults.</p>

                    <h2>Energy Level and Exercise</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Staffies have a moderate to high energy level. They require regular exercise and mental
                        stimulation to stay happy and healthy.
                        Daily walks, play sessions, and engaging activities are important to meet their exercise needs.
                        They are known for their love of people, including children. They can make excellent family
                        pets when
                        raised in a loving and
                        responsible environment. Proper socialization and training are essential to ensure they are
                        well-behaved around other
                        animals.

            <h3>Zeus</h3>
            <p>Zeus is now looking for his forever home! Zeus arrived to us due to a change in his owners living
                situation and they could no longer keep him. He is an active young dog who walks well on a lead, is
                muzzle and crate trained and absolutedly obsessed with belly rubs. He is neutered, chipped and fully
                vacinated.
            <ul>
                <strong>His ideal home would be as follows;</strong>
                <li>With or without another dog</li>
                <li>No cats</li>
                <li>Dog savy kids</li>
                <li>A small garden for zoomies</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="right-dog">
            <h3>Monty</h3>
            <p>Yes we are aware this little fella isn't a staffy! However, we made an exception in this case.
                Originally imported from the United States as a Covid puppy, his owners no longer "had the time" to
                look after him and attempted to put him to sleep. Thankfully, the vets contacted us instead and we
                took him in. He is neutered, chipped and fully vacinated. He is crate trained but can get nervous
                when walking on a lead as he hasn't seen much of the outside world but is improving each day.
            <ul>
                <strong>His ideal home will be as follows;</strong>
                <li>With or without another dog</li>
                <li>Dog savvy kids</li>
                <li>Someone who is familiar with the French Bulldog breed and their requirements</li>

        <div class="center-dog">
            <h3>Sandy</h3>
            <p>When Sandy first came to us, she was a malnourished, frightened little girl. She was initially found
                on the side of the road with a deep gash along her back left leg and thanks to some wonderful
                people, was quickly brought to a vet where she was treated, neutered, vaccinated and microchipped.
                Since then, Sandy has improved remarkably and we are so happy with her. She walks well on the lead
                and loves to play with a tennis ball. Although her crate training remains a work in progress. This
                little girl is ready to
                find her forever home.</p>
            <ul>
                <strong>Her ideal home will be as follows;</strong>
                <li>As an only dog</li>
                <li>Dog savvy kids</li>
                <li>Cat friendly</li>
                <li>A small garden to play in and sunbathe</li>
