                        <h2>Popularity</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>To know the breed is to love the breed. Staffies are a best friend, a soul mate. Previously,
                            as staffies came out of unstable homes, a stigma
                            as an aggressive dog was attached to them and they began to
                            fill dog pounds and rescue centres. Thankfully, this has since been turned around and the
                            breed is now a common sight
                            in homes and in public on dog walks. They are fast becoming one of the more popular dog
                            breeds in Ireland.

                        <h2>Charactertistics</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Staffies are
                            confident, smart and known for
                            their love of people and trustworthy nature. They even carry the nickname "nanny dog" due to
                            their reputation as a
                            child's playmate and guardian. If you are looking for a devoted loyal and connected dog,
                            introduce yourself to a Staffie and their owner and
                            immediately you will witness their open hearts and how they centre their world on their
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The Staffie breed is caring, loving, and will try to talk to you and join in with your
                            conversation. They really
                            identify closely with humans and try to communicate with their loved ones. This is called
                            Staffy speak.
                            They can make little nasal grunts and snore the night through. They
                            are charming in their need
                            to offer you what they have and are very trainable.

                            Staffies are muscular. Like the British bull dog they are heavily muscled which, when you
                            own one and know their
                            kindness, you tend to forget. Others seeing their muscular cheeks tend to be nervous at
                            first. You
                            however soon translate that into the smile and laughter of the Staffy as their personality
                            shines through.</p>

                        <h2>Sociability</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Their sociability with other dogs is broadly based, like all dogs, on being highly socialised
                            with dogs from an early
                            age. Not all staffies that come into our care have been well socialised from a young age but
                            with time and effort, it can be managed and improved. </p>

                <h3>Zeus</h3>
                <p>Zeus is now looking for his forever home! Zeus arrived to us due to a change in his owners living
                    situation and they could no longer keep him. He is an active young dog who walks well on a lead, is
                    muzzle and crate trained and absolutedly obsessed with belly rubs. He is neutered, chipped and fully
                    vacinated.
                <ul>
                    <strong>His ideal home would be as follows;</strong>
                    <li>With or without another dog</li>
                    <li>No cats</li>
                    <li>Dog savy kids</li>
                    <li>A small garden for zoomies</li>

                <h3>Monty</h3>
                <p>Yes we are aware this little fella isn't a staffy! However, we made an exception in this case.
                    Originally imported from the United States as a Covid puppy, his owners no longer "had the time" to
                    look after him and attempted to put him to sleep. Thankfully, the vets contacted us instead and we
                    took him in. He is neutered, chipped and fully vacinated. He is crate trained but can get nervous
                    when walking on a lead as he hasn't seen much of the outside world but is improving each day.
                <ul>
                    <strong>His ideal home will be as follows;</strong>
                    <li>With or without another dog</li>
                    <li>Dog savvy kids</li>
                    <li>Someone who is familiar with the French Bulldog breed and their requirements</li>

                <h3>Sandy</h3>
                <p>When Sandy first came to us, she was a malnourished, frightened little girl. She was initially found
                    on the side of the road with a deep gash along her back left leg and thanks to some wonderful
                    people, was quickly brought to a vet where she was treated, neutered, vaccinated and microchipped.
                    Since then, Sandy has improved remarkably and we are so happy with her. She walks well on the lead
                    and loves to play with a tennis ball. Although her crate training remains a work in progress. This
                    little girl is ready to
                    find her forever home.</p>
